| **MD5**              | Common but outdated hashing algorithm; vulnerable to collisions and fast to compute, often used in older systems. |
| **NTLM**             | Hashing algorithm used by Microsoft for Windows password storage and Active Directory.                            |
| **SHA-1**            | More secure than MD5 but still vulnerable to collision attacks; previously used in SSL and some applications.     |
| **SHA-256**          | Part of the SHA-2 family, widely used in modern web applications, digital signatures, and SSL certificates.       |
| **bcrypt**           | Computationally intensive hashing algorithm with a built-in salt; designed for secure password storage.           |
| **SHA-512 (Unix)**   | Secure hashing algorithm used by many Linux distributions for password storage in `/etc/shadow`.                  |
| **MD5 Crypt (Unix)** | Modified MD5 hash used in Unix and Linux systems for password storage, commonly found in `/etc/shadow`.           |
| **MySQL5/MySQL4.1**  | Hash format used in MySQL databases for password storage.                                                         |
| **WPA/WPA2**         | Hashing algorithm used in Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) networks for Wi-Fi password authentication.       |
